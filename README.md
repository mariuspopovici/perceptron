# Challenge

You are a young scientist working on a hot AI startup.
You just received a text file containing a series of points / coordinates and a type associated with each point.
You’re told to plot all these points on a 800 x 600 canvas. Points with type = 1 should be plotted in “red”, the rest in “blue”.

Then you must extend the program and make it plot a new dot each time the user clicks the mouse at a certain coordinate.

You’re told to implement a perceptron to determine the color of the new dot, based on the data of known dots (the ones received in the file).
